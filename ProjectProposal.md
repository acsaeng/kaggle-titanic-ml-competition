# Project Proposal for Kaggle's Titanic Machine Learning Competition
Author: Aron Saengchan

## 1. Why?: Question/Topic being Investigated (1 pt)

Kaggle is one of the best known sources in the data science and machine learning community for publishing/accessing datasets, collaborating with other practitioners, and hosting competitions. As such, I believe that the most beneficial way to improve my machine learning knowledge at this point is to enter into a machine learning competition.

Many online forums recommend Kaggle's Titanic Machine Learning Competition as one of the best starting points for users entering their first competition. Therefore, I have decided to register myself in this competition and apply what I have learned in this class to build a robust machine learning model as part of this project.

## 2. How?: Plan of Attack (1 pt)

I have created an account and joined the Titanic Machine Learning Competition on Kaggle. To get started, I will watch the provided introductory videos and plan my course of action. Then I will prepare a Jupyter notebook to develop my supervised machine learning classification models and train the provided dataset on it.

I will draw from many of the supervised classification algorithms and techniques taught in class and will use parts of the notebooks from labs 1 to 3 as templates to solve any problems I encounter, as required. If time permits, I will also try to ensemble some models together in an attempt to achieve more accurate results.

## 3. What?: Dataset, Models, Framework, and Components (2 pts)

The following resources will be used in the submission of this project:
- [Kaggle's competition interface](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview)
- [scikit-learn supervised learning classifiers](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html) (e.g., logistic regression, support vector classifiers, random forests, gradient boosting, etc.)
- Ensemble learning - [scikit-learn ensemble methods](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html) and various [tutorials on ensemble learning](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ensemble+learning)

As roughly stated in the previous section, I will develop the machine learning models on a Jupyter notebook and train them using the provided dataset. I will submit my predictions on Kaggle and report the results back in the notebook.
