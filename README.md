# Kaggle's Titanic Machine Learning Competition

**Author:** Aron Saengchan

## Summary 

Kaggle's Titanic Machine Learning Competition is widely known as one of the more popular beginner machine learning competitions. As such, I undertook the opportunity to improve and test my machine learning knowledge through this competition. The Jupyter notebook in this repository contains a collection of the work, submissions, and results in predicting if a given passenger survived the infamous Titanic shipwreck disaster based on a set of provided data.

The first part of this notebook starts by walking though the procedures of importing and analyzing the data, both through general observation and graphical visualization, identifying aspects that may be relevant to what we are attempting to accomplish. The second part follows the steps of properly transforming the data in making it more applicable for a number of supervised classification machine learning models. The four models that were tested include:
- Logistic regression
- Support vector classification
- Random forest regression
- Gradient boosting

These four models were chosen as they are widely known to be effective in traditional machine learning applications, provided the correct conditions and parameters. After each model was tested and optimized, a submission of the results were uploaded onto Kaggle and the score achieved by each was documented. These scores were used for the final interpretation and reflection of the results to come to some conclusions on the topics that were investigated.
